#üöÄ Simple Shell Project
Description
The Simple Shell project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and is focused on creating a custom Unix shell. This shell will be a simple command-line interpreter, capable of executing basic commands, handling errors, and dealing with the "end-of-file" (EOF) condition. It provides an introduction to system programming concepts such as processes, system calls, and environment handling.

The main goal of this project is to implement a basic shell program that mimics some of the basic features of the /bin/sh shell.
